    <h1 class="f">MARS</h1>
<p class="p">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury.
     In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".
     The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
      Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.
      Mars is approximately half the diameter of Earth, with a surface area only slightly less than the total area of Earth's dry land.
       Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity.
        The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.

    <p class="co">Developing and implementing unprecedented optical communications technologies, DSOC will deliver a flight-ready, deep space optical platform assembly and ground data system comprised of a ground laser receiver and transmitter that use existing ground assets.
         Communications between space and ground will employ novel, advanced lasers in the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These systems will be capable of delivering information rates at least 10 times faster than  conventional systems that use comparable mass and power.

        <p class="co"> NASA spacecraft are exploring our planet, our solar system and beyond. How do they tell us what they find out there? Spacecraft send information and pictures back to Earth using the Deep Space Network, or DSN. The DSN is a collection of big radio antennas in different parts of the world.
            There are DSN locations near Canberra, Australia; Madrid, Spain; and Goldstone, California. Those sites are almost evenly spaced around the planet. That means as the Earth turns, we never lose sight of a spacecraft.Our robotic explorers have a lot to do. The tools they use to communicate can’t be too heavy, take up too much room, or use too much power. Small antennas on the spacecraft can beam weak radio signals back to Earth.

            The farther away a spacecraft is, the larger the antenna you need to detect its signal. The largest antenna at each DSN site is 70 meters (230 feet) in diameter.</p>

            <p class="co">
                NASA has developed a new laser beam pointing technology for use in space optical communications.
                 With further development, possible applications include communications from the Earth to spacecraft in Earth orbit and in deep space, such as at the moon and Mars.
                  A possible application is to the Artemis Program for CubeSats in low-Lunar Orbit (LLO). Current architectures use dynamical systems, (i.e., moving parts, e.g., fast-steering mirrors (FSM), and/or gimbals,) to turn the laser to point to the ground terminal and possibly use vibration isolation platforms (VIP). 
                  This patented technology from NASA Ames uses a combined lens system and a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL)/Photodetector Array. 
                  This static system has the potential to replace the current dynamic systems and VIP, dependent on studies for the particular application. 
                  Laser beam pointing is very challenging for low-Earth Orbit (LEO), including science missions.
                   Computer simulations using this design have been made for an application to a CubeSat in LEO.

        <h1>PROPOSED</h1>
      <h1>
            PRIMARY IDEA: Mars Efficient Communication Satellite (MECS)</h1>
<h2>PLACING 2 SATELLITES (MECS-1 & MECS-2) IN AN ORBIT SIMILAR TO STEREO AHEAD AND STEREO BEHIND:</h2>
<h2>
STEREO ORBITAL INSERTION:</h2>
<p class="pr">
The STEREO satellites revolve in a heliocentric orbit around the Sun. Its insertion inside its orbit involved using the Moon's gravity to "slingshot" the spacecraft in their proper orbits. Both spacecraft were originally launched together on a single Delta II rocket on 26 October 2006. Immediately after launch they are placed into highly elliptical orbits that range from just a few hundred kilometers above Earth's surface out to a little beyond the distance of the Moon. Over the next few weeks the two spacecraft slowly separated from each other, and the Mission Operations carefully adjusted the orbits of each to line them up for when both flew by the Moon a few minutes apart on 15 December 2006. The Moon's gravity grabbed both spacecraft, and flung STEREO-Ahead completely away from Earth into its orbit about the Sun. STEREO-Behind was also flung out, but not completely, and came back to swing by the Moon again on 21 January 2007, when it was then completely flung away in the opposite direction into its own orbit about the Sun. 
The MECS will also be launched in a very similar way as of STEREO. The changes that can be inferred are that the “slingshot” will be varied and the heliocentric orbit changes accordingly. Thereby producing a new orbit for MECS-1 & 2 individually. </p>

<p class="pr">
In the case of conjunction between Earth and Mars, it is impossible to establish communication between Earth and Mars for a period of 6 weeks.
But in these cases with the help of MECS1 and MECS2, it is possible to establish communication that can be effective and efficient.</p>
<h2>The working of MECS 1 and MECS 2 at the time of conjunction are illustrated below:</h2>

    <img class="g" src="images/oct211.gif" alt="" width="700px" height="400px">
    <p class="pr"> 
As the sun emits solar radiation(Ultraviolet light,infrared, radio waves X-rays and gamma rays ). There will be distortion when signal is transmitted from Earth to Mars or vice-versa when Sun is nearer to LOC(Line of Communication). So in these kinds of situations MECS 1 and MECS 2 will be very helpful for precise data transmission.</p>
